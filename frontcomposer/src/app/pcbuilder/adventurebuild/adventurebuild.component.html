                                    The enterance of the Ancient City was covered in vines and a thick forest.

                                    As you entered the ruins, you noticed that there are some scribings on the walls. It
                                    was translated to the following:

                                    The city of Technologica was once ruled by two factions, they were 'AMD' and
                                    'Intel'.
                                    <br />
                                    They each control vast territories, resources, and armies of loyalists.
                                    <br />
                                    AMD's faction was portrayed as the innovative rebels, constantly pushing the
                                    boundaries of
                                    technology and advocating for open-source principles.
                                    <br />
                                    Meanwhile, Intel's faction represents the established order, focusing on stability,
                                    security, and efficiency.
                                    <br />
                                    But, due to the greed of power and control, both factions were at war for decades,
                                    until both
                                    nations have drove the city into a complete wasteland.

                                    <br />

                                    You picked up the artifact and the room's walls awere adorned with holographic

                                    In the room, you see another artifact that is placed on a pedestal. Theres a text on the pedestal that reads, The Motherboard.

                                    As you apporach the motherboard, you see that in the middle it has a socket which aligns with the CPU you have chosen.

                                    You flip through your notes, and found out that these are called as 'RAM sticks' or 'Memory sticks'. They serve as the short term memory for the computer.

                                    They seem to align with the Memory Sticks as they have a space between a long and short golden line.

                                    applying force. Press down until you hear a click. Be careful, but
                                    don't be afraid to push firmly, it may require some extra force.

                                    In the middle of the room, you see a Air Cooler artifact that is placed on a pedestal, the fan was spinning rapidly, generating the cool breeze that you felt.

                                    As you approached the artifact, the fan stops spinning and sits quietly on the pedestal.

                                    Upon inspection, you can see that the cooler has bronze like fins that are interconnected with each other into a metal heatsink with a fan sitting on top of it.

                                    Air cooling is simple to install, but it may not be as efficient as liquid cooling.

                                    Upon closer inspection, the cooler has a block with tubes that are connected to a radiator with a fan on it.

                                    Liquid cooling is more efficient than air cooling, as it can transfer heat more effectively.

                                    Before installing the GPU, Lets make sure that you have the necessary cables to power the GPU.

                                    A. Locate the PCIe power cables that came with the power supply.

                                    B. Depending on the GPU, you may need a 6-pin, 8-pin, or 6+2 pin PCIe power cable.
